This library system is covered by the MIT license.  Usage of the
libraries may require agreements to other license terms, such as
the OpenSSL license with the cf_openssl module.

If there exists any license violations due to dependent products,
license adjustments will be treated on a module-by-module basis to
promote choice.

If you wish to contribute to the project, you will need to agree
to a Contributer License Agreement (CLA).  If you are an individual,
the icla.txt file contains instructions.  If you work on behalf of
a corporation, the cla-corporate.txt file may apply to you.
This is to protect the project and its future.
